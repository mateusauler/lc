# lc

This compiler was built for our 'Compilers' discipline.

It is for a simple language based on C and Pascal named `L`.

The language documentation is in the `docs/` directory.

It compiles from source to a subset of i386 assembly for MS-DOS. The generated code file must be assembled before it can be run.
